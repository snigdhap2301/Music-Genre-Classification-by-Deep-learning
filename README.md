# Music-Genre-Classification-by-Deep-learning
This project is an attempt to classify music genres using deep learning techniques and Jupyter Notebook. The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from audio files and classify them into predefined genres.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the GTZAN dataset, which consists of 1000 audio files, each of which is 30 seconds long. The dataset has 10 genres, each with 100 audio files. The genres are as follows:

* Blues
* Classical
* Country
* Disco
* Hip-hop
* Jazz
* Metal
* Pop
* Reggae
* Rock
* Preprocessing
The audio files were preprocessed by converting them to a spectrogram format, which is a visual representation of the frequencies of a sound signal. The spectrograms were used as input to the CNN model.
